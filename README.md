### Hi there 👋

I'm a builder 🏗.

I love to take an idea, flesh out concepts and make it happen in the real world 🌎.

I believe the most powerful tools that a team can have are communication ☎️ and focus 🔎.

The web is a green field ripe for new growth ☘️ and I'm just happy I get to be a part of it 🎉. 

Take a look at some of my ideas for apps - if you want to take one, all I ask is that you leave a comment on it and keep me posted on your progress - https://github.com/korygorsky/product-ideas/issues
