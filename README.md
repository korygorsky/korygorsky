### Hi there 👋

I'm a builder 🏗.

I love to take an idea, flesh out concepts and make it happen in the real world 🌎.

I believe the most powerful tools that a team can have are communication ☎️ and focus 🔎.

The web is a green field ripe for new growth ☘️ and I'm just happy I get to be a part of it 🎉.
